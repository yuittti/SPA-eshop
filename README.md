# Prototype of e-shop as single page application

Implemented on AJAX-technology (jQuery ajax method) with using of HTML5 History API to push and pop history states.

The categories content and the products from chosen category are loading into the MAIN element.

The window is horizontally scrolling.

The events handlers are set with "delegate" method which gives possibility to set handlers for the elements that are not in the DOM yet.

At the moment works with limited functionality - the cart saves during session only the quantity of chosen products and the total price of all chosen products.
